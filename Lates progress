Was working on trigger system
decided on using fine grained effects with variables defined in effect strings in cards (wc3 style) was workning on move effect

This promted a refactoring of card position enums to a more uniform system!

Testing if things still work, currently crashing on entering decks due to minor issur with rendering dropdowns in special case
