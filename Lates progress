Was working on trigger system
decided on using fine grained effects with variables defined in effect strings in cards (wc3 style) was workning on move effect

This promted a refactoring of card position enums to a more uniform system!

Testing if things still work ingame

Need to give players some cards for testing

++found that deck updating doesnt work correctly all the time


Finally managed to get ingame for a test. Locations are mixed up needs fixing
